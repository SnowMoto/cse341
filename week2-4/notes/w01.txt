tricks:
npm init --y = creates a json file to build own script.
npm install (name) --save = save file created.
.gitignore to put node modules to not be pushed.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Snow was here!");
}); - this is a https route.
^ this is moved to controllers and then called in routes to reduce server.js
